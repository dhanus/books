# Books I've read in 2018

I'm posting this list a year late, because 2018 was quite the year. I left my PhD at the end of 2017, meaning that I started 2018 in the throes of introspection as I decided what to work on next. By April, [regret minimization](https://deborahhanus.com/blog/regret-minimization/) had helped me determine that I wanted to start a business around helping people and business through the process of managing a leave. In July, we<sup>*</sup> incorporated and [Sparrow](http://trysparrow.com/)'s landing page went up. In August, we had interest from our first customers, and by the end of the year, we had raised a small round of funding. 

<sup>*</sup> All references to "we" in this paragraph are the royal "we," because I did not have money to hire people until the end of 2018. 

## Customer Research 

At the start of 2018, I was in the early stages of ideation, so I read several of the classics related to understanding problems and testing the effectiveness of simplified versions of potential solutions. 

**[The Four Steps to Epiphany](https://amzn.to/2yDWRR5)** by Steve Blank 

**[Talking to Humans](https://amzn.to/2yzf6XM)** by Giff Constable

**[Sprint](https://amzn.to/2yD1UB8)** by Jake Knapp

**[The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898)** by Eric Ries

## Business 

I also picked up some great books on communication, management, and measuring effectiveness. 

**[Measure What Matters](https://amzn.to/2MRODHY)** by John Doerr 

Note: Usually, I struggle to read books by venture capitalists, because the tone is overly self-important. This was tolerable, because it was told in the voice of several people whose businesses or projects had been made more effective using OKRs.

**[On Managing Yourself](https://amzn.to/2tx4HGv)** by Harvard Business Review

**[Radical Candor](https://amzn.to/2tAbtev)** by Kim Scott

**[How to Raise an Adult](https://amzn.to/2vBe8FT)** by Julie Lythcott-Haimes

Technically, this is a book about how not to be a "helicopter parent," but I think the same strategy applies to developing junior talent into senior talent.

## Biographies of Successful Women

I find reading books about effective management and leadership somewhat disenfranchising, because (a) I find books that draw data-based conclusions most credible, and (b) I often feel the conclusions drawn by most data-based books on leadership do not actually apply to me, because people see women in leadership differently and the books are all written about successful white dudes. Therefore, to get more data for my own prior, I made an effort to read more stories about and by women in power.

This was a really interesting book about the history contributing
