<a href="https://amzn.to/2yzf6XM">**Talking to Humans**</a> by Giff Constable

## Business books 

<a href="https://amzn.to/2MRODHY">**Measure What Matters**</a> by John Doerr 

This is a book about how OKRs are awesome. Usually, I struggle to read books by well-known venture capitalists, because the tone is overly self-important. This was tolerable, because it was told in the voice of several people whose businesses or projects had been eggected by OKRs.

<a href="https://amzn.to/2tym4qs">**Inferior**</a> by Angela Saini

<a href="https://amzn.to/2MTUPzp">**Crazy Rich Asians**</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2u3yKqh">**China Rich Girlfriend**</a>, & <a href="https://amzn.to/2u0ha6E">**Rich People Problems**</a> by Kevin Kwok  

This book did not put anything particularly useful into my brain, but it was quite entertaining. 

<a href="https://amzn.to/2MROwfz">**Nice Girls Don't Get Rich**</a> by Lois P. Frankel

I read this, because it came in a box set with 'Nice girls don't get the corner office.' While the tips in it are important, for the most part, I did not feel like it was written for my demographic.
